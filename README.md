# restaurant-site-with-nodejs
A restaurant website created from scratch with HTML, CSS, and Node.js. Practicing with website design and using Node for my own development.
The database is hosted on a local server, which must be run manually on my machine.

Again, this site is not for a real restaurant, this is just for experimentation.

Working Pages:

- Home: Basic home page.
- Menu: View menu items and place orders.
- Contact: Submit a review and search for past reviews.
